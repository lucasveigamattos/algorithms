# Palindrome Checker

## Description:
Write a function or method that takes in a string and returns true if the string is a palindrome, false otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, "racecar" and "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" are palindromes.

## Constraints:
- The input string may contain alphabetic characters, numeric digits, spaces, and punctuation.
- The comparison should be case-insensitive and should ignore spaces and punctuation.
- You can assume the input string will not be empty.
- The function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

## Test Samples:
"racecar"                         -> true<br>
"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" -> true<br>
"hello"                           -> false<br>
"Was it a car or a cat I saw?"    -> true<br>
"12321"                           -> true
